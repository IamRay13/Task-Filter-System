1. Room air at rest sat of 88% or below
OR
2. Three step exercise test, documenting the following 3 sats:
A - O2 sat at rest without oxygen
B – O2 sat at exertion (walking or other) without oxygen. (88% or below to qualify)
C – O2 sat at exertion WITH the prescribed liter flow of O2.
The results of this testing must be documented in the patient’s chart along with the reason the O2 was ordered, and a copy of these chart notes should be faxed to (484) 362-1480

Hello, Sabrina!

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire if you could assist a patient residing at ADDRESS

The patient is due for an O2 5 YEAR RENEWAL. The account is currently on hold, and it's unclear whether this is due to unresolved billing issues or another reason. We need confirmation on whether we can proceed with calling the patient to schedule a pick-up and exchange, or if the patient needs to settle the balance first. Please advise on the necessary steps to take.

If additional details are needed, please let us know. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thank you and have a great day!

Hi! This is Raymond from AdaptHealth and its family of companies on a recorded line. 

This message is for [Patient's name]

We are reaching out to remind you that your account is due for a 5-year renewal and the good thing is that we have received all the documents that we need from your doctor.

However, we can't proceed with the 5-year renewal because your account is on hold due to an outstanding balance that you need to settle first and the number for the billing department are Billing - [484] 398-6092 / [855] 389-4043.

Once this is settled, please call us back at 484-567-0666. Thank you!           </textarea>
